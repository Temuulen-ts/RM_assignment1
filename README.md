Neil deGrasse Tyson is an American astrophysicist, author, and science communicator famous for his work popularizing science, particularly his roles as Director of the Hayden Planetarium and host of the TV series Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey. He holds degrees in physics and astrophysics and has conducted research in star formation and the Milky Way.

# My summary on the article
Neil deGrasse Tyson’s “Ends of the World” considers how both human and cosmic forces can eventually cause the end—not just of life, but the very universe itself. He separates short-term, human-caused possibilities such as disease, nuclear holocaust, or ecological collapse from much deeper, astrophysical end-timeds that no civilization would be able to avert. Tyson contends that Earth itself will endure these human ends, but life on it will not, and that the very end-times will be determined by cosmic evolution.
He discusses three significant astrophysical endings. First is the demise of the Sun: sometime in five billion years, the Sun will have no hydrogen fuel, will balloon into a red giant, and will engulf Earth, boilling the oceans and atmosphere before shrinking into a white dwarf. Second is the collision between the galaxies of the Milky Way and Andromeda: sometime in seven billion years, the two galaxies will collide. While collisions between actual stars are improbable, gravitational perturbations could throw Earth out into orbit or ice it into interstellar space.
Finally, Tyson illustrates the demise of the universe itself. By observation, we can tell the universe is increasing at such speed that gravity cannot slow it back down. On cosmic timescales, stars will have burned through their fuel, and new stars will no longer be created. Space will be a black void with nothing in it except stellar remainders—black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs. As energy is dispersed, all matter will cool towards absolute zero in the event we refer to as the “heat death” of the universe.
